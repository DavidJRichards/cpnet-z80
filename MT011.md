##Description

The [mt011](https://github.com/markt4311/MT011) is an [RC2014](http://www.rc2014.co.uk/) compaitible ethernet controller based on the [w5500](https://www.wiznet.io/product-item/w5500/)
wiznet chip.

##Building

 make NIC=w5500 HBA=mt011

##Useing

To run this board with cpnet there are a few things that are needed.
A ROM/RAM board with [RomWBW](https://github.com/wwarthen/RomWBW) v3.0.1 or newer.   The MT011 board.  

##On your CP/M console:
###CP/M 2.2
b:pip a:=c:ccp.spr  (assumes your cpnet code is installed on the c drive)
c:[ifconfig](jayacotton/inettools-z80)  (this command get a DHCP address for the wiznet board)
c:wizcfg 0 0 <host ip address> 31100 45
c:cpnetldr  (this loads the cpnet bios code )
c:network k:=c:[0]  (k on my machine, YMMV)

###CP/M 3.0
c:ifconfig
c:wizcfg 0 0 <host ip address> 31100 45
c:network k:=c:[0]

##Caveat's

The above assumes you have a server running on a host machine somewhere.
See cpnet-z80/doc/CpnetSocketServer.pdf for information on running the 
server.
