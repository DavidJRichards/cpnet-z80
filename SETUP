To setup the build environment:

1) Install the dos2unix package, or otherwise provide the 'unix2dos'
   command.  Alternatives that add CR to the lines may be used, but
   require customization of the Makefile (CRLFP and CRLF2 variables).

2) Copy tools/vcpm to a directory on your PATH, and edit it to change
   the JAR variable to match the path to tools/VirtualCpm.jar.

3) Copy tools/vcpmrc into ~/.vcpmrc, and edit it if you want to customize
   the top level (vcpm_root_dir) directory used for the system drives
   (default: ~/HostFileBdos). If you are running the JAVA CP/NET server
   on this system, you should make certain you use a different top-level
   directory or at least ensure the usage is compatible.

4) Create the VCPM root dir, and the "a" subdir.

5) Copy rmac.com, mac.com, link.com, gencom.com, and hexcom.com from
   a known-good CP/M distribution into the "a" subdir. Filenames must
   be lower-case.

To test this setup, type the command "vcpm dir" and you should get a
CP/M directory listing of the "a" subdir.
