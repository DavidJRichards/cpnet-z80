### Description

This is an implementation of a driver for the Wiznet 5500 class ethernet
i/o chip.  The chip is a hard ware abstraction layer that captures most 
of the TCPIP stack protocol inside a single part.  

For more information on the [W5500](https://www.wiznet.io/product-item/w5500/) click here.

The chip provides 8 sockets. These are designated as CP/NET server
mappings by setting the high byte of the socket source port (Sn_PORT0)
to 0x31 and the low byte (Sn_PORT1) to the assigned CP/NET server node ID.
Such sockets will be opened as TCP/IP sockets connecting to the
server specified by Sn_DIPR and Sn_DPORT.

CP/NET messages are sent and received in binary, with no CRC or checksum
(TCP/IP will handle errors/retries).

The client node ID is specified in the W5500 PMAGIC register,
in the common register block. In addition, common registers
must be setup to allow the client to operate on the local
network. This typically includes the gateway (GAR),
subnet mask (SUBR), harware MAC address (SHAR),
and IP address (SIPR) registers.

### Building

make NIC=w5500 HBA=xxx

### Using

A compatible server is implemented in CpnetSocketServer.jar.
Depending on the platform, different utilities and procedures are
used to configure the network. The W5500 does not retain any
settings during power off or RESET, and so generally requires
configuration every time the system is booted.
